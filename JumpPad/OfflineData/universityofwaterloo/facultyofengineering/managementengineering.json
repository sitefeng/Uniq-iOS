        "about": "The Management Engineering program at Waterloo provides a solid foundation in management, engineering, science, and mathematics. On this foundation, the program also has a number of courses focused on one of the three theme areas:\nOperations Research and Supply Chain Management: Operations Research deals with quantitative models of complex operations and uses these models to support decision-making in any sector of industry or public services. Supply chain management is the process of planning, implementing and managing the flow of goods, services and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption.\nInformation Technologies: The Information Technologies theme focuses on how technology is designed and managed to support effective decision-making. Topics deal with technical applications in software design and development, data mining and telecommunication as well as the organizational and social issues associated with the use of information technologies.\nManagement of Technology: The Management of Technology theme builds on the foundation of management topics in accounting, finance, economics, organizational behaviour and organizational design. Courses in this theme deal with operational and organizational issues related to managing innovation and technological change.\nThe capstone design project is intended to provide students with the opportunity to engage in a significant design experience based on the engineering and management knowledge and skills gained in previous courses and on co-operative work terms. The project will reinforce the concepts of team work and project management.",
