    "about": "The complex problems and needs of current and future societies have created challenges for Engineering unparalleled in our history. To interpret and satisfy these needs, Civil Engineers currently direct the spending of more than one tenth of Canada's gross national product \u2013 more than any other professional group. The Civil Engineer must deal with the human impact of engineering \u2013 the social, moral, and legal issues \u2013 to a far greater degree than ever before.\nHistorically, Civil Engineering is the oldest branch of engineering and dates back at least 5,000 years to the profession of master builder involving pyramids, temples, and irrigation projects. Civil Engineering has become an extremely diverse field with opportunities for graduates in many areas of application. Furthermore, the use of electronic data collection methods and the application of computers has revolutionized the practice of Civil Engineering. Consequently, our curriculum is being constantly reviewed in order to produce graduate engineers who can use advanced aids to solve complex problems.\nThe Civil Engineering program is designed to provide the necessary fundamentals of mathematics and the natural sciences as well as to provide perspectives from the fields of the social sciences and humanities.",

        "about": "The Department of Civil Engineering at Waterloo, being one of the largest in Canada, is able to offer elective courses in each of the following areas.\nStructural Engineering: Deals with the design and construction of all types of structures including buildings and bridges. Emphasis is placed on mechanics and the behaviour of materials.\nConstruction Engineering and Management: Intended for students interested in project management, construction materials, construction engineering, and building engineering.\nWater and Waste Management Engineering: Addresses water and waste water treatment, surface and ground water pollution and control, solid and hazardous waste management, contaminant transport and behaviour in the environment. Support areas involving aquatic chemistry, computer modelling, simulation and laboratory experimentation as examples are also stressed.\nTransportation Engineering: Deals with the planning, design, construction, traffic operation and evaluation of streets, highways, airports, and transit systems.\nGeotechnical Engineering: Familiarizes students with the engineering properties of soils, the fundamentals of soil mechanics, and the application of geotechnical data and fundamentals to the design of foundation elements, earth-retaining structures, excavations, earth embankments and highway pavements.\nEngineering Mechanics: For students with a strong interest in a rigorous study of mechanics, applied mathematics and related fields. Leads to an understanding of advanced analysis and serving as a preparation for graduate study in structural engineering, hydraulics, mechanics of solids and fluids, or properties of materials.\nWater Resources Engineering: Deals with the planning, management, design and operation of water supply and distribution systems, flood control and flood hazard mapping, hydrologic and hydraulic aspects of environmental issues, and application of remotely-sensed data to hydrologic and environmental problems.\nExperimental Mechanics: Intended for students with an interest in experimental investigations of the static and dynamic response of structures and machines, and in the development of improved techniques to obtain and analyze experimental data.\nMaterials: Courses in this area are intended to provide students interested in structural engineering, mechanics, or properties of materials with a background in materials science.\nAdditional Areas of Study\nAlternatively, the student can choose a more general pattern of study involving courses from several topic areas, or a program outside the traditional Civil Engineering field. For instance, with the approval of the Associate Chair for Undergraduate Studies, the student may augment Civil Engineering course programs with elective courses from: \nPublic Administration \nPlanning \nManagement Science \nBusiness Administration \nBioengineering \nEnvironmental Health, and others.\nTo this end, the Civil Engineering Curriculum has been designed to allow the maximum possible flexibility while still meeting the requirements for the professional degree. The curricula of the Civil Engineering, Environmental Engineering, and Geological Engineering programs are common in the first year to allow transfer among the three programs up to the end of first year. The Civil Engineering Curriculum enables the students to conduct engineering analysis and design, to perform risk and life cycle analysis, and asset management, and to evaluate the impact of engineering work on the environment.",
