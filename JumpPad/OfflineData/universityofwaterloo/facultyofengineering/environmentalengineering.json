    "about": "Management of water, soil, and air systems are three of the important services provided by engineers. This is an historic responsibility that includes, for example, the provision of a safe supply of potable water for domestic use; reliable delivery to support agricultural production or industrial activity; and control of floodwaters to ensure the safety of developed land. For soil and other earth materials it includes the control of the degradation that can result from human activity, and the development of clean-up strategies for soils that have become contaminated. For air systems, the engineer's responsibility includes the reduction and management of contamination.",
