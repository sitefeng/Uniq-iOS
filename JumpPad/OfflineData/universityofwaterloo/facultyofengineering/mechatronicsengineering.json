    "about": "Mechatronics engineering is an integrated approach to the design of computer controlled electro-mechanical systems. Mechatronic applications are pervasive in our everyday lives, so much so that we often take them for granted. Familiar examples of mechatronic systems include automotive anti-lock braking systems (ABS), SLR cameras, and aerospace 'fly-by-wire' systems. These mechatronic designs are much more than simply the addition of a microcontroller to an existing mechanical system – their complete and properly integrated redesign is what makes them successful. An integrated design philosophy has been incorporated into the development of this program.\nIn order to successfully combine mechanical design, computers, software, and electronics with an integrated design approach, the mechatronics engineer requires an understanding of a breadth of topics. The tools that make up the mechatronics engineer’s repertoire are drawn from many departments across the faculty: Mechanical, Electrical and Computer, and Systems Design Engineering. The result is a multi-disciplinary program, which provides students with a unique set of skills.\nThe program is a rich blend of courses prepared and delivered specifically for Mechatronics Engineering students, designated with the MTE label, and courses selected from other engineering disciplines: Mechanical Engineering (ME), Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), and Systems Design Engineering (SYDE). Mechatronics Engineering students thus benefit from a breadth of expertise.",
