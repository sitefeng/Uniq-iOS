  "applicationProcess":"Waterloo Engineering offers direct-entry programs, meaning that students are admitted into specific engineering disciplines in first-year studies. This approach is different from institutions that offer a general first year, in which students select and compete for their discipline prior to the second-year of studies. Applicants must select one Waterloo Engineering program (civil, mechanical, systems design, software, etc.) on the OUAC application. This should be the program you are most interested inâ€”not the one that you think is easiest to get into. Applicants will be able to submit two alternate engineering program choices on the Admission Information Form, for which they will be considered if they are not accepted into their first choice. Preference for each program will be given to students who select that program on the OUAC form.",
