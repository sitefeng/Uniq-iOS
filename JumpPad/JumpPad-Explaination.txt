What is ItemUID?

The most prominent feature of the app is all the colleges and programs that the user can explore. Contents of these item are shown right away once the app starts. In order to organize all these items into a meaningful manner, an "Item UID" or "Item Unique Identifier" is created.

ex: "0002-004-001"  or  "0002004001"

The first 4 number represents a specific college, followed by 3 digits that represents a Faculty within that college. The last three represents a Program.

-> You Cannot specify a program without specifying its college and faculty: 0000-000-002 X

-> If you want an itemUID to represent a college, set last 6 values to zero: 0001-000-000
