    "about": "Geological engineering is an attractive discipline for students who wish to pursue the challenge of combining the complexity of nature and engineering design, who are interested in the physical mechanics of the earth\u2019s surface, who enjoy travel and the outdoors. The subject has seamless transitions to geotechnical engineering and engineering geology.\nGeological Engineering is the application of geological knowledge to the siting, design, construction, operation and maintenance of civil engineering structures and facilities. It is one of the rapidly growing fields of engineering reflecting society\u2019s developing interest in the stewardship of the environment, managing risk, and creating a safer world. The profession has a direct impact on the foundation of the Canadian economy, which is built upon the exploration and development of its vast natural resources in a sustainable manner that protects them for the benefit of future generations. Geological Engineers provide the expertise to develop mines, petroleum reservoirs (oil and natural gas), hydro-electric dams and reservoirs, groundwater and surface water resources, as well as building and managing the necessary infrastructure to bring the resulting commodities to market. The Geological Engineering profession shares common roots with that of Civil Engineering and Earth Sciences, and is an interdisciplinary program at the University of Waterloo involving the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering as well as the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, in the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Science, respectively.  \nThe field of geological engineering encompasses a wide range of activities and issues including the geological characterization of complex foundations of major buildings and structures, development of natural resources (mining, water, hydroelectricity, forestry, oil and gas), the engineering safety of major infrastructure (dams, reservoirs, offshore drilling platforms, pipelines, roads and railways), and the assessment of geohazard risk (landslides, earthquakes, volcanoes, and the stability of natural dams). It also includes aspects of such fields as project finance and insurance, forensic geological engineering, and the application of geological knowledge to the repair and preservation of cultural heritage sites. In step with Civil Engineering, Geological Engineering has evolved into an extremely diverse field as the demands of society have evolved, providing opportunities for graduates in many areas of application. Furthermore, the application of computers and electronic instrumentation has revolutionized the practice of Geological Engineering. Consequently our curriculum is being constantly reviewed in order to produce graduate engineers who can use advanced tools to solve complex problems. ",
